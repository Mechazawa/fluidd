Fluidd (and FluiddPI) has built in support for web cameras.

To configure FluiddPI, edit the file found here `/boot/fluiddpi.txt`.
Instructions are contained within.

You can add up to three cameras to display on your dashboard.

Currently supported types are;

- MJPEG Stream
  This is the traditional mjpegstream service. The service pushes images to
  fluidd at the configured resolution and FPS you have setup. This requires
  a lot of bandwidth, and can cause issues with unstable network connections.

- MJPEG Adaptive
  This will PULL images from the mjpegstream service, using the snapshot URL.
  You can set a target FPS, and your browser will try to keep up with the
  intended target. This can be a more reliable approach for some.

- IP Camera
  This is an experimental option. Effectively, it swaps out the `<img>` tag
  for a `<video>` tag. You should only use this if you can provide a URL
  that supports native HTML5 video tags.

Head on over to the UI Settings page to define your cameras.
